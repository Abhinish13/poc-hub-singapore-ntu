# Updating User Whitelist

JupyterHub provides a means for users to create their own Jupyter notebook instance. Only users who can login in with the configured authentication provider, and who are listed as a user in the JupyterHub database can use JupyterHub to create a Jupyter notebook.


## Initial Setup of Users

Note that when JupyterHub is initially deployed, the list of normal users will be empty. In this state, where no users are listed in the database, JupyterHub will allow any authenticated user to create Jupyter notebook instances. If you need to restrict the set of users who can create Jupyter notebooks, you must add at least one normal user. This requirement is independent of whether any admin users have been declared.

JupyterHub provides two ways of adding users. If the set of users is going to be fixed and doesn't need to be changed over time, you can load the list of users through a config map and restart JupyterHub. This will cause that list of users to be added to the JupyterHub database.

If the set of users may need to change, you should not use the config map method of loading the users, and leave the config map empty. Instead, a user designated as an admin, should load the list of users through the admin panel of JupyterHub.

The reason for using the admin panel when changes need to be made is that, if a user is included in the list held by the config map, and the user is deleted via the admin panel, when JupyterHub is restarted, the user will be added back to the JupyterHub database again from the config map. To avoid this you would need to manually keep the list in the config map synchronised with the database, and remove the user from that list as well as removing them via the admin panel.

## Using the Admin Panel

Use of the admin panel to manage users is the recommended approach that should be used, even if the user list is fixed and not expected to change.

To add users via the admin panel, you need to be logged in as a user designated as an admin in JupyterHub. You should access the _Control Panel_ and then the _Admin_ panel.

From the admin panel, select on _Add Users_. From the popup window, you can add a new user. If you need to add more than one user, they need to be listed one per line. You cannot list multiple users on the same line.

To delete a user, find the user in the list of users from the admin panel and select _delete_. If the user has a current Jupyter notebook instance, that Jupyter notebook instance will be shutdown, when removing the user from the database.

## Querying Config Map

If using the config map to load users, to get a copy of the current contents of the config map for the JupyterHub instance, you can run the script:

```
$ scripts/extract-user-whitelist.sh coursename > coursename-user_whitelist.txt
```

The contents of the config map will be displayed as output, so can be saved to a file by directing output to a file as shown.

Note that this list is not what is recorded in the JupyterHub database. Any users added through the admin panel of JupyterHub will not be in this list, unless they were also added to it as a separate manual step.

If you want to see the full list of users in the JupyterHub database, use the admin panel, or access the backup files created from the database.

## Updating Config Map

If not using the recommended method of adding users via the admin panel of JupyterHub, and you want to load them via the config map, create a file which contains the LDAP usernames of the users. Add the users one per line.

To update the config map, run the script:

```
$ scripts/update-user_whitelist.sh coursename coursename-user_whitelist.txt
```

The arguments are the name of the course and the file containing the list of users. If you don't supply the arguments, you will be prompted for the inputs.

You will also be asked whether you want to trigger a new deployment of JupyterHub. This will cause JupyterHub to be restarted so that the updated config map is read.

When JupyterHub is restarted, any new users listed in the config map, will be added to the JupyterHub database, and those users will now be able to create a Jupyter notebook instance, so long as they can also login.

If you are using the config map to load the users, and need to remove a user, two steps are required.

You first need to remove the user from the config map for the user whitelist. This is done using the same process as adding a user, except that you are removing the LDAP username from the file containing the user whitelist, before updating the config map with the modified file.

A second step that must then be done, is to also delete the user from the admin panel in JupyterHub. If you do not do this, the user will still be recorded in the JupyterHub database. This is because JupyterHub doesn't synchronise the database with the list from the config map when entries are removed.

Performing the second step of deleting the user from the admin panel will remove them from the JupyterHub database and they will not be able to use the JupyterHub instance. Note though that if the user was also listed in the config map for admin users, they will be added back into the JupyterHub database the next time the JupyterHub instance is restarted. Ensure therefore that the user is also removed from the admin users if they appeared in both the user whitelist and list of admin users, and they should not retain any access.

Because of the need to perform two steps when removing users, if you know you will need to keep making changes, it is better to load users and make changes through the admin panel and not use the config map. 

## User Database Backups

If the user whitelist stored in the config map has not been kept in synchronisation with what is in the database, it is possible to retrieve an up to date copy from the JupyterHub instance. This is done by retrieving it from backups which are periodically made from the database.

To see the list of files in the backups directory, first identify the name of the pod for the JupyterHub instance using ``oc get pods``.

```
$ oc get pods -n coursename --selector app=jupyterhub,deploymentconfig=jupyterhub
NAME                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jupyterhub-40-pgm8w   1/1       Running   0          3d
```

Once you have the name of the pod, you can list what backup files there are by running ``oc rsh``.

```
$ oc rsh -n coursename podname ls /opt/app-root/notebooks/backups
admin_users-2018-07-08-04-01-17.txt
user_whitelist-2018-07-09-01-45-16.txt
```

The suffix of the files is of the form ``-YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss.txt``.

Find the most recent copy of the ``user_whitelist`` file. To copy the file back to the current host, run ``cat`` on the file and save the results to a file.

```
$ oc rsh -n coursename podname  \
  cat /opt/app-root/notebooks/backups/user_whitelist-2018-07-09-01-45-16.txt >
  coursename-user_whitelist.txt
```

A new backup file is created each time the JupyterHub instance is restarted. A backup will also be periodically made if it is detected that a change was made to the list of users in the whitelist since the last time a backup was made.

You can therefore use the backup files as an audit trail as to when changes were made to the list of users in the whitelist.
